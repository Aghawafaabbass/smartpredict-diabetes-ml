 🔬 SmartPredict: Machine Learning for Early Diabetes Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
Early detection of **diabetes** can save lives by preventing severe complications like heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage.  
This project compares **five machine learning algorithms** on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to forecast diabetes:  

- 📈 Logistic Regression (LR)  
- 🌳 Decision Tree (DT)  
- 🌲 Random Forest (RF)  
- 👥 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 📊 Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

👉 **Key finding**: Random Forest achieved the highest performance, showing the strength of ensemble methods in healthcare prediction.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Replaced invalid `0` values with mean values  
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`  
   - Train-test split (80/20)  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented with `scikit-learn`  
   - 5-fold cross-validation for reliability  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy (%)  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve  
   - Feature Importance (Random Forest)

## ✨ Key Takeaways  
- ✅ **Random Forest** performed best (highest accuracy & stability)  
- 📈 Logistic Regression = great **interpretability** for healthcare  
- ❌ KNN = weakest model, sensitive to scaling & noise  
- ⭐ Important predictors: **Glucose, BMI, Age**
